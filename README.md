### TF2 Duel
This is a sourcemod plugin to allow dueling. Let's get some things out in the air right now.

Q. Does this work like the built-in dueling minigame?
A. No. It works through chat commands.

Q. Will it give prizes/advance my dueling badge?
A. No. A custom web app is planned.

## Building

* Copy the included `morecolors.inc` to your sourcemod/scripting/include directory.
* Compile tf2duel.sp with sourcepawn.
