## TF2 Duel
This is a sourcemod plugin to allow dueling. Let's get some things out in the air right now.

**Q. Does this work like the built-in dueling minigame**
A. No. It works through chat commands.

**Q. Will it give prizes/advance my dueling badge**
A. No. A custom web app is planned.

### Building

* Copy the included `morecolors.inc` to your sourcemod/scripting/include directory.
* Compile tf2duel.sp with sourcepawn.

### Credits
The sourcepawn code is written by me, fernferret.
The colors.inc is written by Dr. McKay, see that file for his info

### License
Honestly, don't be evil with this code. There's your license. If for some reason VALVe deems this code in violation of their TOS or some other random crap, don't use it anymore.
